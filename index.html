<p>Howdy, and Welcome!</p>
<p>I'm a software engineer who grew up around New York City, and studied Software Engineering in Miami.  I specialize primarily around networking, operating systems, cloud technology, virtualization, and big data infrastructure, but take pride in a fairly broad skill set.</p>
<p>Outside of the profession, you can find me working out puzzles, driving, and tinkering with all manners of things.</p>
<!--<p>Between 2012 and 2014, I interned at Microsoft three times, before finally coming on full-time in 2015.  All of this work has been centered around Windows' networking stack, with specific focuses in Hyper-V's software defined networking, as well as power, and enterprise wireless applications.</p>-->
<!--I studied Computer Software Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Miami.
I grew up in Westchester County, New York, just north of New York City. <br>
I enjoy puzzles, driving, and am interested in big data, virtualization, and operating system/low-level development. <br>-->
