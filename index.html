<p>Welcome!</p>
<p>I'm a technologist with a software development and electrical engineering background with special experience dealing with real time market data, support, and implementation and support of latency critical trading systems.  I have additional specialties in networking and operate a custom global anycast content distribution and packet acceleration network under ASN 207419.</p>
<p>Specific experience (finance): ION, raw market data feeds, FIX</p>
<p>Specific Experience (general): C/C++, Python, C#, cloud environments administration, kernel dev, tuning, implementation, and deployment of Windows, Linux, and BSD systems.</p>

who grew up around New York City, and studied Software Engineering in Miami.  I specialize primarily around networking, operating systems, cloud technology, virtualization, and big data infrastructure, but take pride in a fairly broad skill set.</p>
<p>Outside of the profession, you can find me working out puzzles, driving, and tinkering with all manners of things.</p>
<p>Between 2012 and 2014, I interned at Microsoft three times, before finally coming on full-time in 2015.  All of this work has been centered around Windows' networking stack, with specific focuses in Hyper-V's software defined networking, as well as power, and enterprise wireless applications.</p>
<!--I studied Computer Software Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Miami.
I grew up in Westchester County, New York, just north of New York City. <br>
I enjoy puzzles, driving, and am interested in big data, virtualization, and operating system/low-level development. <br>-->
