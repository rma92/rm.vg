The Heroine

The heroine is bold, but she is not unjust; she gives every detail equal attention. She is emotionally strong, fiercely independant [sic], as much as any man, but she will not admit that. No, she can't admit that. She is a sexual being, as well as affectionate, and very much faithful; beyond question to those who deserve it, and few ever do. She has suffered unfairly in her life, and she constantly searches for a way to make amends for the wrongs she percieves [sic] herself to have comitted [sic], she will fail in this attempt; only become stronger, brighter in time. There is a natural beauty that radiates from her, and it is not always physical. And as independant [sic] as she is, she will likewise never admit that she is searching for a man stronger than herself; someone who can take some of that burden for her. She may never find him, and she knows she may never find him, but she will not settle; settling on the wrong man is quitting, and the heroine never quits; never compromises her principles, never betrays her nor anyone else. The heroine is sound, and brilliant, and beautiful. Every woman should strive to be like the heroine. The heroine is not perfect, and she knows she is not -- has a measured note of all her faults -- but she tries to be as close to perfect as she can, and that alone makes her stand out. She is a diamond stuck in bedrock.

There exists somewhere enough love, beauty, suffering and bigotry to kill a man. Enough time, enough money, enough politics, and religion, and family -- give me a happy man and I'll write you a novel. Give me a sad man and I can still write you one, you just won't like the ending.

Love is the only pure thing in this world; still, we muddy it.
