How to submit: Upload answer file (.doc, .pdf or .jpg file with answers via Blackboard); also, submit hard copies in 
class on the due date 

SECTION I: NAME THE PHENOMENON / EFFECT / MECHANISM (5 points) 
-The occurrence of higher temperature in urban areas as compared to surrounding rural areas:
    _Latent Heat_ 
-The absorption of longwave terrestrial radiation by atmospheric gases such as carbon dioxide and methane: 
    _Greenhouse Effect_ 
-Mechanism /method of heat transfer involved when you touch a hot surface:
    _Conduction_
- The name of the isotherm that connects all points of highest mean temperature:
    _Thermal Equator_ 
- The zone of convergence of the trade winds:
    _Intertropical Convergence Zone_

SECTION II: TRUE OR FALSE (10 points) 
- Tropospheric ozone protects us from the harmful UV rays of the sun: 
    _False (Stratospheric Ozone protects)_ 
- The lower atmosphere gets heated mostly from terrestrial radiation and to a lesser extent from insolation: 
    _False (Mostly insolation)_
- At the Equator, low angle of insolation, variable day lengths, and high seasonal variations create an energy 
deficit:
    _False (Stable)_ 
- In the Northern Hemisphere, the coldest time of the year occurs in December at the time of the winter solstice: 
    _False (Slight delay)_
- Nitrogen and oxygen are the most abundant greenhouse gases in the atmosphere: 
    _False (not greenhouse gases)_ 
- You would expect a tropical island to have a high degree of continentality: 
    _False (Well, it does snow in Hawaii...)_
- Evaporation is a cooling mechanism: 
    _True (see a Swamp or Evaporative Cooler, but don't use it in Miami)_
- Weather (rain, fog, storms etc) occur primarily in the troposphere: 
    _True_ 
- Ozone depletion is caused due to the greenhouse effect: 
    _False_ 
- Closer the isobar -> steeper the pressure gradient -> weaker the wind: 
    _False (Steeper pressure gradient makes stronger wind)_ 

SECTION III: CIRCLE THE CORRECT ANSWER CHOICE (5 points) 
- Reykjavik, due to its _costal_ (coastal/inland) location, enjoys a _maritime_ (continental/maritime) 
climate. 
- Land has a _lower_ (higher / lower) specific heat than water and therefore heats more _quickly_ (slowly 
/ quickly). This is one of the main reasons why temperature in the interior of large landmasses is more 
_extreme_ (extreme / moderate) than temperature in coastal areas. 

SECTION III: TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS (5 points) 
1) If the temperature at the surface of Earth (at sea level) is 40°C, what is the temperature at 2000 meters if 
the normal lapse rate is 6.4 °C/1000 m? Show your work 
2000[m] / 1000 [m] = x / 6.4 °C;
2 * 6.4 [°C] = x;
12.8 [°C] change; 
40 - 12.8 [°C] = 
27.2 [°C] = Temperature at 2000 meters.

2) What is the temperature at which the 0
Celsius and the 0
Farenheight scales coincide? Show your work 
C = 5/9 * (F - 32)
x = 5/9 * (x - 32)
x = -40.
