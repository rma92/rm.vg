<h1>Paper 2</h1>
<p>Legal decisions, in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century America,
were made based on the proper rule of law, including judges' careful attention
to legal precidents and their implications. Do you agree or disagree with this
statement?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Frame your answer with your own thesis, three substantive topical
  areas, and well-chosen examples and quotes from historical legal cases
  and background materials.
  </li>
  <li>Write an eight to ten page paper, selecting from the entire range
  of course readings, films and class discussions.
  </li>
  <li>You must include at least one substantive area focusing on a topic
  studied after the first writing assignment.
  </li>
  <li>Papers should be presented in 12pt font in either Courier New,
  or Times New Roman font style, and margins, headers, and
  footers of all pages must be 1" in length.
  </li>
</ul>

<b>The paper is due on Thursday, December 11.</b>

<h2>Notes from last paper</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Went well: A topic that united the subtopics. Made the papers easy to read.</li>
  <li>A topic is not a thesis. 
    <b>You need to tell your reader what about that
  topic you are arguing.</b></li>
  <li>In the next paper, ask questions: Do I have an argument, or am
  I just presenting a topic?</li>
  <li>Am I arguing, or writing a narrative (description) of a point of
  view?</li>
  <li>A little bit of readjustment of the narratives could have easily
  made it an analytical section.</li>
  <li>"Should" or "ought to" makes a value judgement, but does not make
  an argument. One can argue that "something was unfair, and here's why".
  </li>
  <li>You can't pass judgements on how people did things in the past.</li>
  <li>If you feel something was wrong, this may not be a bad place to
  start, but it is necessary to make an analytical argument instead of
  simply passing judgement.</li>
  <li>Some people messed up the citations. A parenthetical documentation
  must have the specific name (title) of the document, and page number.
  <b>( <u>Specific Name</u>/title, page #)</b>. The page number printed
  on the document, not the PDF page number. For movie, no page number.
  The author is acceptable if the author is clear.</li>
  <li>Types of quotes and arguments are intertwined very closely, and
  this makes a good paper.  The citation needs to fit into the 
  argument.</li>
  <li>Self-plagiarisation is still plagiarisation.</li>
  <li>If your second paper has a higher grade than your first, this 
  will be weighed higher, as improvement is important.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Outline</h2>
<ul>
<li>
  During the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, there were a variety of court cases that may have been decided against proper rule of the law, and while ignoring careful attention to legal precedents and their implications, however, the legal system ultimately overcame these cases, and progress was made in expanding freedoms to various parties.
</li>
<li> The Second Red Scare and McCarthyism
  <ul>
    <li> Rosenberg Trial: FBI and Court attempted to indite Ethel Rosenberg in order to get Julius Rosenberg to admit to sharing weapon designs with the Soviets. David Greenglass was encouraged by the prosecution to turn over his brother in law (Julius), by telling a false testimony.  The inditement of Ethel failed to cause Julius to come forward. Deputy D.A.: "She called our bluff."</li>
    <li> McCarthy's politics produced a list of people who were to be found guilty by association, something which lacks circumstantial evidence. This type of law appeared in the 1300s in England, and was later abolished due to its ridiculous nature (video). It was also used by the Nazis (who were, of course, a bit ridiculous by American standards).  Guilt by association has little to no stable, legal grounds for prosecution, but was used on several occasions. (Trial of Milo Radulovich, classified evidence, ridiculous grounds)</li>
    <li> McCarthy's politics also caused the Attorney General (?) to be required to maintain a list of "communist" and "communist sympathizing" organizations and people.  List had no stable legal background, but was used in court as a means of indicting people. (First Amendment is supposed to guarantee freedom of speech, even to go against the government. You are allowed to go against the government until it becomes an "imminent and pursuant threat" to violently overthrow the government, which saying you are a communist is not an example of)</li>
    <li>Resolution: McCarthyism fell, more scrutiny due to press now.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Comstock law / Freedom of speech / contraceptives
  <ul>
    <li> Margaret Sanger 1917 trial: Women did not have the right to copulate with contraceptives. (lack of reason given) </li>
    <li> Sanger was also denied her first amendment rights, as the comstock law was found to supersede the first amendment. Constitution is "supreme law of the land", and should not be superseded by mere acts. She was prosecuted for disseminating literature in the mail, even when not actually using the mail.</li>
    <li>Gentlemen had a particular bias against Sanger, evidenced by her physicians (in the 1920s) being ostracized from the general community of physicians in New York.</li>
    <li>Resolution: Contraception became available and more accepted int he 1920s and later, after a law allowing contraception to be prescribed by physicians was passed. Her actions may have been against the "spirit of the law", but would later be found to be acceptable in many circles.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Shorter Work day, Minimum wage, Healthy/Safe working conditions.
  <ul>
    <li> Triangle Factory Fire: owners locked doors to prevent stealing, fire occurs. One level of workers evacuates promptly, the level above that was not informed of the fire, many died. Owners were basically given a slap on the wrist.  Max Blanck and Isaac Harris were indicted for first- and second-degree manslaughter. Case was won by the defense declaring that the defense failed to prove that the owners knew the doors were locked, and was able to destroy the credibility of a survivor by having her repeat a testimony many times, and suggesting she had memorized it.  Blanck profited from insurance after a successful civil suit against him, and was arrested for locking the doors to the factory, but only fined $20.</li>
    <li> Muller vs. Oregon -- Women are physically disavdantaged, and need to be protected. It is the state's duty to protect them. This was unsatisfactory to feminists, as it placed a heavy emphasis on discrimination of the sexes.  Similar to Sanger case, there may have been a bias here, as the ruling set a legal precedent to use sex differences.</li>
    <li> </li>
    <li>Resolution: After Triangle factory, workplace laws became more favorable. Muller was tested in Adkins v Children's Hospital. More recently, the courts have been more favorable towards women, especially after the nineteenth amendment passed.
